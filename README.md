Warehouse Wars Game 

A player (cool face) is able to move into any empty, adjacent square. If the empty space has a box in it, it could be moved by player. The player can move a long line of boxes (used object recursion for that). Monster can kill the player going to the same square. The goal of the game is to completely sorround each monster by given boxes. The player has to authenticate itself to play and to store the scores in a scoreboard.

- Back End - JQuery, Ajax (JSON transport), JS
